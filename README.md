**Project Overview: Zombie Conga Linked List**

**Description:**
This project introduces a dynamic and versatile implementation of a doubly linked list, designed to showcase proficiency in C/C++ syntax, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and data structures, specifically linked lists. The program revolves around a zombie conga list, demonstrating the practical application of the developed linked list.

**Topics Covered:**
- C/C++ Syntax
- Pointers
- Dynamic Allocation of Memory
- Data Structures: Linked Lists
- Object Orientation

**Specifications:**
The key focus of this project is the creation of a templated doubly-linked list data structure entirely from scratch. The templating ensures that the data structure is flexible enough to store any type of data. While leveraging the versatility of C++ features, the project mandates the development of a self-contained linked list, encouraging the use of std::string (from #include <string>) when necessary. Built-in structures can be employed to support algorithms, but the primary objective is to create a reusable linked list that can be adapted for various applications.

**Usage:**
1. **Compilation:** Compile the program using the command "make" in the terminal.
2. **Execution:** Run the compiled program with "./Zombie."
3. **Documentation:** Further details and guidelines are available in the README.txt file included in the project documentation.

This project not only serves as a demonstration of technical skills in C/C++ but also as a foundation for a reusable linked list that can be extended and adapted for diverse purposes. Feel free to explore, contribute, and utilize this project as a valuable resource for learning and practical implementation.
